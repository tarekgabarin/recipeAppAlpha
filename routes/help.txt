I have the following function that I want to run first before my other requests. In addition, I have an object called
recordObj that keeps track of what tasks my program has done.

let recordObj = {

    gotRecipeDocument = false;

}

let getRecipe = (recipeName) => {

    return Recipe

        .findOne({name: recipeName})

        .then((recipe) => {

            if (recipe) {
             // the recordObj property is set to true when I find
             return recipe
            }


        })

        .catch((err) => {
            console.log(err);
        })

     }

I have functions that I want to run only after getRecipe is finished running and gets a recipe document. So I wrote the
following Promise.
